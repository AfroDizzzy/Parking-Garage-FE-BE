# Parking-Garage-FE-BE

A simple application that allows employees to book the single car park space for a specific date.

Initally the project was run using commands found in the root package.json. However, due to possible symlink issues with diffrently formatted drives (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77912), one should follow the readme's in each subpackage.
